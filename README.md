# Arael-Reason

A machine learning library written in Reason.

Currently only K Means, Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are working.
The code probably looks very messy since I'm still learning Ocaml and certain
this like the module system I have not been able to figure out for Reason. It's 
kinda hard to tell if things haven't been implented yet in Reason or if it's just
not documented and different enough from Ocaml to not be obvious.

Feel free to submit pull requests if you want to lend a helping hand. :)
