# Arael-Reason

A machine learning library written in Reason.

Currently only K Means, Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are working.
The code probably looks very messy since I'm still learning Ocaml and certain
this like the module system I have not been able to figure out for Reason. It's 
kinda hard to tell if things haven't been implented yet in Reason or if it's just
not documented and different enough from Ocaml to not be obvious.

Currently I can't seem to figure out how to use modules that I've created which
is why I've copied functions from MlMath into the modules that need those functions.
I've also copied functions from Regression into LinearRegression and LogisticRegression
for the same reason.

Feel free to submit pull requests if you want to lend a helping hand. :)
